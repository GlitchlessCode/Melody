<h2>About Melody</h2>
Melody was originally developed because the best music bots shut down, and most alternatives had core features such as effects locked behind a paywall. Melody started as a bot that was just used in a server with some friends and then became a project that I released publicly for anyone to use and maintain.

<h2>Features</h2>
Melody is a feature-rich Discord music bot. It offers a clean look, easy-to-use commands, and active development. Check out the list below for a full list of features:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Multi-server support</li>
<li>Genius song lyrics integration</li>
<li>Volume controller</li>
<li>Full player control with pausing, seeking, and volume control</li>
<li>Queue support with skipping, returning to the previous song, viewing queued songs, queue shuffling, queue clearing, adding songs to the end of the queue, or the next position in the queue</li>
<li>Listening statistics that allow you to see how many songs you've listened to, how many songs you've skipped, and how many times you've shuffled the queue</li>
<li>Saving songs to your direct messages for you to refer back to later</li>
<li>20+ effects to spice up your music</li>
<li>Search autocomplete</li>
<li>Support for YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, and many more</li>
<li>Playlist integration that allows play-shuffling and looping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
For a detailed installation guide, check out our <a href="https://github.com/NerdyTechy/Melody/wiki/Installation">Installation Wiki page</a>.

<h2>Analytics</h2>

By default, Melody tracks basic anonymous analytics when you start up the bot. To disable this, set the `enableAnalytics` option in the configuration file to **false**. To learn more about the analytics Melody sends, <a href="https://github.com/NerdyTechy/Melody/wiki/Analytics">click here</a>.

<h2>Genius</h2>

Melody utilises Genius' API to find lyrics for songs. A Genius API key isn't required to use the bot but will make the lyrics feature far more reliable. Obtaining one is free, and can be done so <a href="https://genius.com/api-clients">here</a>.

<h2>Hosting</h2>

Want to host this bot online? Any hosting company that provides Discord bot hosting (or VPS hosting if you know what you're doing) will work, but I highly recommend <a href="https://techy.lol/revivenode">Revivenode</a> (Affiliate Link).
